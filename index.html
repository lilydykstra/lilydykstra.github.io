        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>My name is Lily Dykstra. I am a sophomore year student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study Creative Technology and Design in the School of Engineering.</p>
        <p>This website is my portfolio containing independent work as well as chosen projects from my time at CU Boulder. These projects are the results of programs such as, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Lightoom. Additional programs include, Figma, Rhino7, SketchUp, and Arduino. My independent work is mainly done via sewing machine.</p>
        <p> This website was last updated 1/9/24. I am in the process of redoing a lot of it and mainly my work page and the subsequent links are not 100% working and/or styled.</p>
