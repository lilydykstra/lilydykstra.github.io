        <p> Hi! My name is Lily Dykstra. I am a sophomore year student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I major in Creative Technology and Design in the School of Engineering and minor in Mathematics.</p>
        <h4> Professional:</h4>
        <p>Within my time at CU Boulder I have had the opportunity to study a variety of topic such as: web design, graphic design, photography, circuits, prototyping, principles of design, and much more. Within these opportunities I have learned on programs such as: Adobe Creative Cloud, Figma, programming langauges (python, html, css, js). </p>
        <p> I am currently a Learning Assistant with the Atlas Institute at CU Boulder assisting with our Image class. In this class we teach the principles of photography, animation, and VR/AR. I help students with the basics of Adobe Creative Cloud platforms, such as Photoshop and Lightroom, and HTML during out AR/VR unit. Additionally, I work as mathematics tutor in the different levels of calulus.</p>
        <h4> Personal:</h4>
        <p> A little bit about me! One of my favorite things to do is create. I have been sewing for the past 4 years. I will sew clothes, bags, trinkets, and any pattern I can get my hands on. My main goal is to be as sustainble as possible. My favorite thing to make are patchwork bags. I use denim scraps from old jeans and patch them together in random or intentional designs. </p>
        <p> Another favorite thing of mine is swimming! I grew up near the beach in Los Angeles and as a competetive swimmer so if theres a body of water, expect me to go in it!</p>
        <h4> So nice to have you here!!</h4>
