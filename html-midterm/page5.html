        <h1> Change Log:</h1>
        <p> A few (1-2) sentences each describing what was wrong and what I changed</p>
        <ul>
            <li> page 1: 5 errors all having to do with the html code</li>
            <li> page 2: 3 errors involving the code, 1 logic error with the page structure</li>
            <li> page 3: 2 errors having to do with the code and 1 logic error with how the page is structured</li>
            <li> page 4: 3 errors about the code and 1 logic error with page strucutre </li>
            <li> page 5: correct nav bar, all the errors and their fixes explained in a cohesive way</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Page 1:
                <ol>
                    <li> I fixed the emphasis tag that was used as "e" and not "em" and without a closing tag</li>
                    <li> Fixing the "em" helped fix the non closed tags</li>
                    <li> I added the doctype and html tags to the document</en></li>
                    <li> Error #4: </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Page 2:
                <ol>
                    <li>I fixed the <> and added /b back into it which in turn fixed the bold element not being 
                    closed.</b></li>
                    <li> Fixing the bold tag also fixed the paragraph and body elements having unclosed elements. </li>
                    <li> This also fixed that fact that h2, h3, hr, p, could not be a child of the open bold element</li>
                    <li> I fixed where h2 was a child of bold and put the bold element inside of h2 </li>
                    <li> I NEED TO FIX THE WHERE DO I GO LINK</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Page 3:
                <ol>
                    <li>I fixed one of the list elements being labeled as l instead of li</li>
                    <li> I fixed the closing argument of td not having anything in it by adding td into the empty tag</li>
                    <li> Error #3: </li>
                    <li> Error #4: </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Page 4:
                <ol>
                    <li>Error #1:</li>
                    <li> Error #2: </li>
                    <li> Error #3: </li>
                    <li> Error #4: </li>
