        <h1> Change Log:</h1>
        <p> A few (1-2) sentences each describing what was wrong and what I changed</p>
        <ul>
            <li> page 1: 5 errors all having to do with the html code</li>
            <li> page 2: 3 errors involving the code, 1 logic error with the page structure</li>
            <li> page 3: 2 errors having to do with the code and 1 logic error with how the page is structured</li>
            <li> page 4: 3 errors about the code and 1 logic error with page strucutre </li>
            <li> page 5: correct nav bar, all the errors and their fixes explained in a cohesive way</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Page 1:
                <ol>
                    <li> In item 3 of the bulleted list, there was no closing list tag so I added one </li>
                    <li> In cell 3 of the table there is no closing td tag so there is a fatal error that says there is a starting h2 tag within the table. I added a closing td tag to fix the error </li>
                    <li> Additionally, there was no closing tr tag after the second table row so there was an error still saying an h2 starting tag was the table, so I added a /tr tag to clos it.</li>
                    <li> Another h2 issue was that the table tag was never closed only open so the above issue persisted and I added the /table closing tag after all the table data.</li>
                    <li> The image was not showing up because there was no specific foler to go into. I added the img folder for the correct pathway </li>
     
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Page 2:
                <ol>
                    <li> The bolding of New Beehive Inn was not properly closed. There were the tags but no /b in them, so I added the content to correctly close it </li>
                    <li> There was an closing p tag with open elements inside of it which was fixed when I added the /b into tje closing bold element</li>
                    <li> There was an unclosed element which was the incomplete bolded element and this error was fixed when I correctly clsoed the bold element</li>
                    <li> Furthermore, because b wasn't closed p,h2,h3,h6,hr was technically a child of b which is now allowed, and this error was also fixed when correctly closing b</li>
                    <li> There was an error that said there were unclosed elements within the closed body tag which is not allowed, so when I fixed the bold closing tag that was corrected. </li>
                    <li> Logic error:</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Page 3:
                <ol>
                    <li> It was missing the DOCTYPE title, so I added that to the very top above the any starter tags</li>
                    <li> It was also missing adding the lang=en to the html opening tag, so I put that into it.</li>
                    <li> There was no data within the head tag so I added the meta data, the title, and linked the css sheet</li>
                    <li> Logic error: The footer was in the middle of the page instead of the bottom, so I changed its position the position property in css document from absolute to relative to make it the same position as it is in the html document. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Page 4:
                <ol>
                    <li> The page did not have a DOCTYLE at the top so I added that in.</li>
                    <li> None of the images had alt attributes so I added those descriptions in.</li>
                    <li> The orange cat was in the table but did not have any closing or starting td tags so I added them around the image</li>
                    <li> The dogs singing did not have a closing td tag so I added one.</li>
                    <li> The create did not have an opening td tag so I added one</li>
                    <li> Logic error: </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
