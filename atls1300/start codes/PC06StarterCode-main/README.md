# PC06StarterCode

This repo contains useful code to help you with PC06 and animating with pygame in general. Be careful when searching for examples with pygame because many examples do not demonstrate code quality or usee advanced programming practices.

These examples demonstrate animations relative to the class skill level.

You should cite and count borrowed lines unless otherwise mentioned in the script description.

## In this repo:
1. **PygameStart.py ** - start code for working with pygame. Includes event detection that allows window closure.
2. **Pygame_Anim_Example.py** - an animation demonstration showing wraparound animation. It contains the main() function, which will be covered in Week 9 (10/18)
3. **pygame_example_drawing.py** - examples of using different drawing functions in pygame.
