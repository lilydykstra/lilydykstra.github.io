"""
1. Authors listed, and detailed description given at the top of each script/module* describing:
    a. all authors' full names
    b. what the game is (name and brief description of visuals)
    c. how to initialize the game (hitting a key, simply pressing run)
    d. game play instructions: goals, rules and when the game ends
    e. intended users (“College/ATLAS student,” “stressed out/busy person” is not sufficient. Consider marginalized identities in this approach.)
    f. how the game supports intended users
2. Code should be bug free, including silent errors
3. Gameplay must be complete (see above) -- all conditions must be possible and tested for errors
    a. Has splash/start screen
    b. Has win/lose/draw conditions, where applicable
    c. Has game over screen
    d. User instruction/demo - appropriate for target user.
4. Code (scripts, modules) must follow good code quality:
    a. does what is in description
    b. contain no errors or defects
    c. is easy to read & well labeled with comments
    d. should be DRY (few repeating lines--use loops, lists, objects, etc.)
5. Code must be Object Oriented Programming ONLY. You:
    a. Make a game Manager class (PC09)
    b. Have a Player class (if applicable)
    c. (Weeks 12-13) Use inheritance to make good and bad elements to the game (example: bubbles that if collided with speed up the game (bad) or slow down the game (good)).
        i. calling super().__init__() in the CHILD class init method will inherit methods and attributes
        ii. calling the PARENT.__init__() in the CHILD class init method will inherit attributes ONLY (no methods)
6. All borrowed code must be cited or you will receive a 0 (or worse)
    a. Don't cite your own code
    b. Class code should be cited unless from OOP Repo
